# Simple Kernel

**Disclaimer**: This project is strictly for educational purposes and is not intended for production use. The code may not function perfectly or seamlessly, and no guarantees are made regarding its reliability or stability in real-world applications.

This project aims to simulate the fundamental functionality of an operating system kernel by artificially generating signals and processes similar to those a kernel would handle. The purpose is to provide an educational demonstration of core kernel concepts and operations, rather than a fully functional or production-ready system.

## Execution Instructions

To run this project, follow these simple steps:

1. Compile the project:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

2. Run the project:
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

After compiling and executing, the project will generate several `.o` files in the filesystem. Once you are finished with execution and testing, it is recommended to clean up these  files by running:

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove any temporary files and keep your project directory tidy.
