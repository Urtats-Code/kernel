# Simple Kernel Project
This project aims to create a simple kernel from scratch to explore the fundamental workings of kernels and operating systems. Developed in C, this project offers a hands-on approach to understanding core OS concepts, including memory management, process scheduling, file systems, and hardware interfacing.
