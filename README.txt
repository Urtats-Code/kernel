Simple Kernel

Disclaimer: This project is strictly for educational purposes and is not intended for production use. The code may not function perfectly or seamlessly, and no guarantees are made regarding its reliability or stability in real-world applications.

This project aims to simulate the fundamental functionality of an operating system kernel by artificially generating signals and processes similar to those a kernel would handle. The purpose is to provide an educational demonstration of core kernel concepts and operations, rather than a fully functional or production-ready system.
